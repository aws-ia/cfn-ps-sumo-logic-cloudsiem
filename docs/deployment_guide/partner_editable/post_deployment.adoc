// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== If using an existing S3 bucket

If you use an existing S3 bucket with logs, create an SNS topic (SumoSNSTopic-{StackName}) that subscribes to the Sumo Logic sources. After the deployment completes, add that SNS topic to the S3 bucket events. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/enable-event-notifications.html[Enabling and configuring event notifications using the Amazon S3 console^].

=== View the Sumo Logic dashboards

After the deployment completes, the Sumo Logic apps are added to your Sumo Logic personal-account library in a folder named `SumoLogic Amazon QuickStart Apps for AWS Orgs <date>`, as shown in <<qsappfolder>>.

[#qsappfolder]

Under the SumoLogic Amazon QuickStart Apps <date> folder, there are subfolders that represent each app along with the date and timestamp.

To open the services dashboard, choose its folder in the Sumo Logic console. For instance, under the Amazon GuardDuty folder, open the Amazon GuardDuty – Overview dashboard to see detected threats.

=== Firewall Manager security group

The deployment creates a security group that is used by Firewall Manager only as a comparison reference for the security groups that are in scope of the policy. Firewall Manager doesn't associate it with any resources in your organization. You can update the security group for your use case. For more information, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/security-group-policies.html[Security group policies].

Firewall Manager creates a web ACL in each account that's managed by Firewall Manager.

=== AWS Firewall Manager​ managed Network Firewall policies

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/network-firewall-policies.html[Firewall Manager Network Firewall Policies] allow Firewall Manager to manage AWS Network Firewall firewalls for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud VPCs across your organization in AWS Organizations. For each account and VPC that's within policy scope, Firewall Manager creates a Network Firewall firewall and deploys firewall endpoints to VPC subnets, to filter network traffic.

To narrow the scope of your policy, you can tag your VPCs with *key: sumo-awsqs-nf-policy* and *value: network-firewall*. For more information about tagging your resources, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html[Working with Tag Editor].

=== AWS Firewall Manager​ managed WAF policies

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-policies.html[Firewall Manager WAF Policies] allow Firewall Manager to centrally mandate the application of AWS WAF Rule sets and Web ACLs to endpoints (ELBs, CloudFront Distributions, and API Gateway) in the environment.

The solution enforces the policies based on resource tags. For more information about tags, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html[Working with Tag Editor].

=== Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream

Monitor your delivery stream to ensure that it has enough throughput to accommodate your organization's WAF logs.

== Test the deployment

=== AWS account

After the deployment completes, you see the main stack, QuickStartApps, in addition to multiple nested stacks.
